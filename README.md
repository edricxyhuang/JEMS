##User Overview:	
	We've all experienced days where we want to go out, but we don't know what to do. Our website takes in parametrers such as interests (art,sports, etc.), zip code, how far you are willing to go, and budget to suggest activities happening around your area that you could be interested in. We would create accounts and use the past events you went to to suggest future ones.
	We would log in using facebook and the first page would include a map, a search panel, and a link to see all your options. When you click on that button you can see all of your choices  

##Tools to Use:

		Google Maps
