##User Overview:	
We've all experienced days where we want to go out, but we don't know what to do. Our website takes in parametrers such as interests (art,sports, etc.), zip code, how far you are willing to go, and budget to suggest activities happening in your area that you might be interested in. You can create an account and we will use your past events to suggest future ones.
You can log in with your facebook account and the home page includes a map, a search panel, and a link to see all your suggested options.
